        # Problem Statement

        The <dfn>current ~ ongoing</dfn> industry practices for chlorophyll removal from green seed canola oil involve the use 
        of acid-activated (AACs). However, AACs are associated with a variety of problems, including 
        product loss, lackusability, and environmental concerns.
